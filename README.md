# Regimenate
Exploring Daily Routine Efficiency through Data Analysis
## Inspiration
We were motivated to explore the **everyday routines** of ordinary individuals with the aim of **enhancing** their **quality** of life.
## What it does
We will conduct an analysis and **exploration of the daily routines** of the average person by inputting their routine data and leveraging machine learning algorithms to **evaluate and quantify their efficiency.**
## How we built it
By **gathering data** provided by users themselves and **creating various datasets** for comparison, we train the machine learning model to **evaluate and offer efficiency comparisons.**
## Challenges we ran into
While generating multiple datasets during the machine learning process, we faced difficulties in maintaining **consistent accuracy** across these datasets, especially when **introducing variations.** Consequently, the **efficiency results** displayed variations, Yet we **successfully overcame** those challenges.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Even though we observed variations in machine learning **results and efficiency**, we **enhanced performance by training the model** with various deviations and making algorithmic adjustments to **attain improved outcomes.**
## What we learned
We've **obtained valuable insights** into creating a **well-balanced daily routine** for the typical person. Furthermore, we've honed our skills in **training machine learning models** to calculate **routine efficiency** based on a variety of datasets.
## What's next for Regimenate
We have developed an **automated regimen** that caters to both **individual users and a diverse user base.** Our future plans involve expanding into **health and habit analysis**, as well as implementing these features into **apps and websites for open-source** accessibility
